Machine learning is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence and enables systems to learn without explicit programming.

2-)
In a supervised learning model, the algorithm learns on a labeled dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data. 
An unsupervised model, in contrast, provides unlabeled data that the algorithm tries to make sense of by extracting features and patterns on its own.
Supervised algorithm example --> image classification, machine translation, stock prediction
Unsupervised algorithm example --> K-mean, GMMs, HMMs

3-)
Validation Set: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters. The evaluation 
becomes more biased as skill on the validation dataset is incorporated into the model configuration.
Test Set: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset.
